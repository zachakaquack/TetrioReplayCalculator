# TetrioReplayCalculator
Allows you to calculate certain things on a replay (.ttrm) from tetrio.

## Automatically calculates: 

- [x] APP
- [x] Player's Handling
- [x] Total / Per Round Lines Sent
- [x] Total / Per Round Lines Received
- [x] Total / Per Round Max Spike
- [x] Per Round Singles, Doubles, Triples, Quads, T-Spin Singles, T-Spin Doubles, T-Spin Triples, and Perfect Clears
- [x] Per Round Pieces Placed

You can also calculate average APM, PPS, VS, and APP for your choice of rounds.
This program only works for 1v1 VS. (i have not tried it with anything else, so be wary.)

If you have any ideas on anything else you want to be able to calculate in the program, message me on discord - zachakaquack

# [HOW TO INSTALL AND USE TETRIO REPLAY CALCULATOR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6544Zsfbkyo)
1. Go to [the releases page.](https://github.com/zachakaquack/TetrioReplayCalculator/releases)
2. Find the most recent release, then under **Assets**, click on **ReplayCalculator.exe** to download.
3. Upon loading the .exe, Windows may yell at you, but you can ignore it. The video linked [above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6544Zsfbkyo) shows me downloading and opening this program, if you don't trust me.

## Extra
Works for replays after 11/26/24; Tetrio at some point changed their way of storing their replay files and it breaks this program. Sorry, I don't know when. If it breaks, it's _probably_ because of that.
Runs on py 3.12 w/ CustomTkinter. hopefully works for you lol
