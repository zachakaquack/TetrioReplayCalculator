# TetrioReplayCalculator
Allows you to calculate certain things on a replay (.ttrm) from tetrio

Automatically calculates app, and allows you to calculate averages for specific rounds.
Upon run, it opens a file window asking you to open a .ttrm file. Program will do everything after that. Doesn't work the greatest with like a billion rounds, so don't use this program if you played a ft100 lol

Works for replays after 11/26/24; Tetrio at some point changed their way of storing their replay files and it breaks this program. Sorry, I don't know when. If it breaks, it's _probably_ because of that.

If you have any ideas on anything else you want to be able to calculate in the program, message me on discord - zachakaquack

Runs on py 3.12. w/ CustomTkinter and json. hopefully works for you lol
