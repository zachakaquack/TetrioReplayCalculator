# TetrioReplayCalculator
Allows you to calculate certain things on a replay (.ttrm) from tetrio.

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE TETRIO REPLAY CALCULATOR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6544Zsfbkyo

Automatically calculates app, and allows you to calculate averages for specific rounds. This program only works for 1v1 VS. (i have not tried it with anything else, so be wary.)

Upon run, it opens a file window asking you to open a .ttrm file.

Works for replays after 11/26/24; Tetrio at some point changed their way of storing their replay files and it breaks this program. Sorry, I don't know when. If it breaks, it's _probably_ because of that.

If you have any ideas on anything else you want to be able to calculate in the program, message me on discord - zachakaquack

Runs on py 3.12. w/ CustomTkinter and json. hopefully works for you lol
