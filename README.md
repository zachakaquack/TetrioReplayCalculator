# TetrioReplayCalculator
Allows you to calculate certain things on a replay (.ttrm) from tetrio

Automatically calculates app, and allows you to calculate averages for specific rounds.
Upon run, it opens a file window asking you to open a .ttrm file. Program will do everything after that.

Works for replays after 11/26/24; Tetrio at some point changed their way of storing their replay files and it breaks this program.
