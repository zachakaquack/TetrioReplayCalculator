# TetrioReplayCalculator
Allows you to calculate certain things on a replay (.ttrm) from tetrio

Automatically calculates app, and allows you to calculate averages for specific rounds.
Upon run, it opens a file window asking you to open a .ttrm file. Program will do everything after that.

Works for replays after 11/26/24; Tetrio at some point changed their way of storing their replay files and it breaks this program.

If you have any ideas on anything else you want to be able to calculate in the program, message me on discord - zachakaquack
